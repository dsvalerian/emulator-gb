# emulator-gb

## Overview
**emulator-gb** is an emulator of the Nintendo GameBoy handheld video game console released in 1989, written in Kotlin. This is my first Kotlin project, so it is being used to facilitate my learning of Kotlin as well.

## Status
**Early Stages:** This project has barely been started and is not even close to being in a working state.
